Aiolos - toy websocket server with JDK 7 networking
===================================================

Aiolos is a very simple websocket server I wrote for
my networking class. It's by no means ready for any production
use whatsover, but it works and I believe it can serve as a good example
of using asynchronous networking channels introducedin JDK7. I had
some trouble finding examples for the new JDK 7 networking when I was writing
this (early 2012) so perhaps this can serve someone.
